## Frontend (FE)

The `FE/` folder contains the frontend code of the Library Management System. It's built using technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. For detailed information on setting up and running the frontend, refer to the [FE README](fe/README.md).

## Backend (BE)

The `BE/` folder contains the backend code responsible for handling API requests, business logic, and communication with the database. It's built using Java, Spring Boot, and Maven. For detailed information on setting up and running the backend, refer to the [BE README](be/README.md).
